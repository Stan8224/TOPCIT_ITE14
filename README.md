# TOPCIT_ITE14

The school proposes the development of an “IT Certification Review App” to help BSIT students prepare for certification exams in programming, databases, software design, and IT business fundamentals. Many students struggle with unorganized study materials and lack accessible tools that match their learning needs.

To ensure the app effectively supports students, the project will follow the Design Thinking process. This user-centered approach will allow the team to understand students’ challenges, define their needs, generate ideas, create prototypes, and test solutions with actual users. The goal is to design an intuitive, helpful, and engaging review platform that improves students’ exam readiness.

PROBLEM OF THE STATEMENT:
“Students need a way to study for their TOPCIT exam effectively and efficiently because they often feel overwhelmed and not motivated when reviewing.”
